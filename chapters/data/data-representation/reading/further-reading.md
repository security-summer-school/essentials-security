## Data Manipulation

We can manually change the way data is represented, so that it will be easier to read or structure.

For large chunks of data, this could take a long time, so, in order for us to be efficient, we will have to use certain automated ways of manipulating the information.

Tools that can help us achieve this goal are ranging from programming and scripting languages, to programs like MS Excel.
A useful Python tool for this purpose is `pandas`:
