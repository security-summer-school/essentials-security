# Introduction

In today's session we'll be discussing data and the many ways we can represent it.

## Reminders and Prerequisites

For this session you'll need:

- Basic knowledge of Python (as seen in the [first session](../../../scratch-linux/welcome-to-linux/))
- Numbers

## What is Data?

Data is information.
This plain text is data, but more than that, data can be encoded and represented in many ways.
Generally, we represent data in a suitable format for our specific purpose.
For example, if we want the most basic way to encode data, the one that computers "think" in, we'll use `Binary`.
Sometimes, we need our data to not be confused with something else, so, for example we encode `Binary` to `Base-64` in order to get the information on the other side of the wire uncorrupted.
